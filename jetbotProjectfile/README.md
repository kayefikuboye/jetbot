# jetbotProj
Using Tensor flow for Jetbot line following and obstacle avoidance.
Take samples of picture using game pad control or you can manually select the sample data and make sure you take tha picture in a strategic way.
train the samples and get the desire epoch for the trained data set
make sure you examine and optimized those data using the tensor flow, deploy your trained model and the demonstratiion will be just as it is described below
